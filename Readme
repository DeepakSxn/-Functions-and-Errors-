#Calculator
This Solidity program is a simple calculator contract. The purpose of this program is to demonstrate basic arithmetic operations on the Ethereum blockchain using a smart contract.

##Description
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract provides a function to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, and multiplication) on two input numbers. It also stores the result of the last calculation.

###Getting Started
1.Specify the version of Solidity:
  i.Ensure your Solidity compiler version is >=0.8.9.
2.Creation of the smart contract:
  i.Add a state variable to store the result of the last calculation.
  ii.Implement a function to perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) based on the input operator.
  iii.Implement a function to retrieve the last result.
###Executing Program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.
